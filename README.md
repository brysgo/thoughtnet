This is the start of a horizontally scalable AI that can be taught anything and fed any data, shares knowledge on everything, does not need confusing hyperparameters.

Almost forgot, it is built to run in the browser, so the worlds most powerful AI cluster could one day come online with a few million clicks of a link.

[Here](https://brysgo.github.io/thoughtnet) is the running example, isn't quite ready for prime time yet but.

# Todo list

* [x] Create algorithm that supports this model
* [x] Test algorithm on some traditional supervised learning datasets
* [x] Visualize algorithm in browser
* [ ] Design and implement p2p model
* [ ] Build UI for choosing, adding, sharing sources and targets
* [ ] Find creative ways to demonstrate flexibility of algorithm
* [ ] Optimize for efficiency and maybe implement GPU version
